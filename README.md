wallaby-fevm-msg-signer
===

A minimalist command line tool for interacting with the Wallaby testnet
to create Filecoin actors from EVM binaries, and to invoke methods.

Eventually, it will be possible to upload EVM binaries to Filecoin using
standard Ethereum JSON-RPC clients. Until that time, here is a custom
tool that speaks to the hosted GLIF endpoing using Lotus JSON-RPC calls.

# Install

First, make sure you have a recent install of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your system.

`npm install -g @jimpick/wallaby-fevm-msg-signer`

# Usage

```
Usage: wallaby-fevm-msg-signer <command>

Commands:

  create-evm-actor <bytecode file>
  invoke-evm-actor <actor id> <method signature> <optional params (hex)>

Options:

  --seed-phrase=<phrase>
  --account-number=<integer>
  --endpoint=<url>
  --evm-actor-cid=<cid> (for create-evm-actor)
  --milestone=<codename> (for create-evm-actor)

Environment Variables: (can be set using .env file)

  SEED_PHRASE    ACCOUNT_NUMBER  ENDPOINT
  EVM_ACTOR_CID  MILESTONE
```

The command line is designed to mimic `lotus chain create-evm-actor`
and `lotus chain invoke-evm-actor`. You can use this tool and the
public GLIF API gateway for the Wallaby testnet instead of having
to install a Lotus node yourself.

# Quickstart

## Compile a contract

Make sure you have the Solidity compiler installed
([instructions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/installing-solidity.html)).

Make an empty directory for your files.

Let's start with the "Storage Example" (from the [Solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html)):

SimpleStorage.sol:

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.4.16 <0.9.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint storedData;

    function set(uint x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

Compile it:

```
$ solc --bin --hashes SimpleStorage.sol -o output
Compiler run successful. Artifact(s) can be found in directory "output".
$ ls output/
SimpleStorage.bin		SimpleStorage.signatures
```

## Set up your wallet

Go to the GLIF Wallet at https://wallet.glif.io/?network=wallaby

Under "Burner Wallets", click "Create Seed Phrase", and copy it or
save it somewhere.

Here's an example:

```
flush flight sponsor captain thumb strategy tuna relax conduct theme involve jacket grass labor puzzle unaware recycle trouble enable bubble blanket escape license ticket
```

(don't use this one, create your own)

Download it or copy it into a file called `dontlookhere.txt` in your directory.

The seed phrase can be passed to the tool as an option (eg. --seedphrase="flush flight...")
or set in the SEED_PHRASE environment variable.

For convenience, we will create a `.env` file with the following contents:

```
SEED_PHRASE=@dontlookhere.txt
```

The special "@" prefix tells the tools to read the contents of the seed phrase from
the file named "dontlookhere.txt".

While you are in the GLIF Wallet, also record the address for "Account 0". Initially
it will have no funds, so you will need to fund it from the Wallaby Faucet.

For our example, the address looks like: `t1maw6wyyzizomhry25uwvlv7z6bali7ihkseznhi`

## Get funds from the Faucet

Go to the Wallet Faucet here: https://wallaby.network/#faucet (scroll down)

Enter in your address and complete the Captcha, and wait for the funds to be
deposited.

It's a good idea to save the message ID so you can track it.

eg. `bafy2bzacedooqx3lkogqeg5cfeodo37ub3p36ejmuqn5z7tot7z75ikcnda3w`

You can use the GLIF Explorer to check your balance: https://explorer.glif.io/?network=wallaby

You can view your address there, or view the message from the faucet as well.

## Create a Filecoin Actor

Once you are funded, and your seed phrase is set (either in an environment
variable or in the .env file), you can create your actor:

```
$ wallaby-fevm-msg-signer create-evm-actor output/SimpleStorage.bin 
Warning: Milestone not selected and EVM Actor CID not specified, defaulting to EVM Actor CID for "selenium" release.
         Actor install may fail if wallaby testnet has been updated.
From Address: t1maw6wyyzizomhry25uwvlv7z6bali7ihkseznhi

Gas Used: 10534252
ID Address: t01082
Robust Address: t2tciiwqwkohc3ifsmfadxcqmtb5vdzaeavb7bngq
```

The code is now installed into the Wallaby testnet and has an actor
address of `t01082`.

Every time this is run, a new actor will be created with a new address.

## Invoke a method

We'll need the method signatures:

```
$ cat output/SimpleStorage.signatures
Function signatures:
6d4ce63c: get()
60fe47b1: set(uint256)
```

Let's call the `set(uint256)` method:

```
$ wallaby-fevm-msg-signer invoke-evm-actor t01082 60fe47b1 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000abcd

✔ Waiting for message to appear on chain................
Message Executed at Height: 7526

No value returned.
```

Great! Now let's call the `get()` method:

```
$ wallaby-fevm-msg-signer invoke-evm-actor t01082 6d4ce63c
From Address: t1maw6wyyzizomhry25uwvlv7z6bali7ihkseznhi
✔ Sending message to GLIF gateway

✔ Waiting for message to appear on chain.............
Message Executed at Height: 7532

Decoded Result (hex): 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000abcd
```

It worked! The value we stored is the value that was returned!
